# Hi, I'm Jan Havlin

Backend-focused hardcore software developer with a passion for Rust and a strong   
foundation in TDD.   
I aim to grow my impact, focusing on backend development and gradually venturing   
into solution architecture, while keeping a distant eye on frontend technologies   
for a well-rounded perspective. 

**Current focus:**  
- **Rust** – my first language; pure power, heavy but beautiful    
- **Go** - pragmatic and lightweight; faster backend services, simpler development
- **Elixir** – functional, Actor-model-inspired, addressing a unique niche of the backend 

**What I'm learning / exploring:**  
- Cloud infrastructure and services
- AI integration projects  
- Web3 technologies  

**Expertise:**  
- Backend systems design  
- Test-driven development (unit, integration, fuzz testing)
- Original thinker, motivated to tackle interesting and challenging problems
- Writing maintainable and stable code for long-term projects  

**Aspirations:**  
- Collaborate with international teams on ambitious, pioneering projects  
- Expand into staff/lead seniority and solution architecture roles  

**Other interests:**  
- Art, creativity, and pondering programming from unique perspectives  
- Combining logic with imagination for elegant solutions

**Fun fact:** I see programming as a pursuit as creative as art, another field that I find deeply    
satisfying. Both can feel intangible at times, but I’ve never minded thinking in the abstract.
