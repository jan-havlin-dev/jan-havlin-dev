# Hi, I'm Jan Havlin

Backend-focused software developer with a passion for Rust and a strong foundation in TDD.  
I aim to expand my skills towards full-stack development and eventually solution architecture.  

**Current focus:**  
- **Rust** – my first language, the foundation of my programming journey  
- **Elixir** – functional, Actor model inspired, perfect for certain backend use cases  
- **TypeScript** – appreciating strong typing and clean architecture  

**What I'm learning / exploring:**  
- Full-stack development  
- AI integration projects  
- Web3 technologies  

**Expertise:**  
- Backend systems design  
- Test-driven development (unit, integration, fuzz testing)  
- Writing maintainable and stable code for long-term projects  

**Aspirations:**  
- Collaborate with international teams on ambitious projects  
- Expand into full-stack and solution architecture roles  

**Other interests:**  
- Art, creativity, and exploring programming from unique perspectives  
- Combining logic with imagination for elegant solutions

**Fun fact:** I see programming as a creative pursuit, much like 
art, another field I’ve explored. Both can feel a bit intangible 
at times — but I’ve never minded thinking in the abstract.
