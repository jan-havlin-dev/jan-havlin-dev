# Hi, I'm Jan Havlín

Rust expert and performance-focused backend developer, specializing in distributed   
systems, microservices, and data-intensive applications. Commited to designing    
scalable, low-latency solutions and exploring innovative ways to integrate AI into   
real-world problems. I also keep an eye on the evolving Web3 space to stay connected   
with emerging technologies. Strong foundation in TDD, system design, and   
production-ready architectures. 

**Languages:**  
- **Rust**  
- **Go** 
- **Elixir** 

**Expertise:**
- Backend systems architecture; designing scalable, resilient, and high-performance    
  systems
- Test-as-value approach; advocating testing as a core principle for reliable    
  and maintainable production systems
- Strategic problem solving; approaching complex technical challenges with    
  unconventional, effective solutions
- Maintainable & robust code; building systems that remain stable and extensible     
  over the long term

**Aspirations:**  
- Collaborate with international teams on ambitious, pioneering projects  
- Gradually expand into staff/lead seniority and solution architecture roles

I value communication that is clear, honest, and direct, dry humor, and thoughtful,   
professional collaboration across the team.

On a philosophical note, I see programming as a creative craft — not unlike art, another   
vast domain reflecting humanity at its finest — both grounded in structure, yet driven   
by abstraction. It feels much like two kinds of energies that may complement each other   
surprisingly well — one precise and structured, the other expansive and imaginative —    
working together to shape what does not yet exist.
